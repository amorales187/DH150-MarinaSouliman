# DH 150: Assignment 4 
## Introductory Steps 

## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
	  This project is meant to support users in finding ways to engage with social causes, with asylum and immigrant rights as the focal point. With this project, I hope to understand how to engage younger populations when it comes to social issues that may not relate to them directly. Furthermore, due to the weight of this social topic I will be exploring how certain aspects regarding the social issue could affect a user’s emotional connectedness. By making the topic more accessible and clear, it could benefit how a user interacts with volunteerism for nonprofit organizations. 
  
### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
	  This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for esteem and belonging because it helps them engage in an activity that raises their self esteem through action. It also provides a community of other volunteers that offers a sense of belongingness. Users who engage with social issues are more likely to exhibit strength and independence, both crucial for esteem. 
  
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
    The current solution to satisfy the need for engaging with volunteerism or social causes varies. Users might get involved when their friends get involved with certain organizations or they may have a personal link to the movement that they want to engage in. Users might search for organizations nearby, hear through word of mouth or get involved on their campus if they are students. If users are looking for more focused causes they may go to larger organizations to volunteer, completely ignoring smaller nonprofits needing their focus as well. 

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
    The current limitations to engaging with smaller nonprofits is not knowing what many of them do and how to get involved. Within the scope of asylum and immigrant rights, there’s a lot of misinformation with regards to news organizations. Those interested in helping the cause might not know that there are tangible actions they can engage in order to help those seeking asylum and often at times actions that they can cater to their set of skills as well. Improving the website design to better engage the user could be very helpful in retaining volunteers and exploring different avenues that volunteers can take. 

## Step02: Target users 

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: people interested in social causes, potentially more socially aware with refugee and asylum seeking topics 
Preference: users prefer spending their time helping their community, interested in engaging with human rights 
Expertise: no expertise is necessarily required to get started 

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
There are several ways users can engage with nonprofit organizations such as The Advocates for Human Rights. Although a lot of the volunteering is done local to the nonprofit, there are online resources to expand one’s knowledge and reach regarding asylum seekers and refugees. Users would most likely engage with the website from their home, not necessarily interacting with anyone. This is why an appropriately engaging design is crucial to retaining volunteers. In terms of the actual goal of the nonprofit, there are local events as well as a variety of resources and events that are more central to the legal system so volunteers can engage wherever they may be in the United States. There are varying places users would do the activity whether that is defined as engaging with the website or volunteerism. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would search the internet for nonprofit organizations about refugee or asylum seekers if they were looking for these types of organizations. For opportunities within the Advocates for Human Rights, they would search the volunteer tab and look through opportunities there to engage with their organization and events. 

## Step03: Pick research methods 
The observation method I employed was participatory observation. I had several activities with my interviewee to explore the social issue and his potential interest as well as his reaction to the topic.

## Insights from the Interview 

## Reflection 
I think stepping away from the website and getting a more holistic view was really important. My participatory observation session was really fruitful and I really enjoyed learning more about what a typical person’s interest in the social issue could be. I had a bit of difficulty with coming up with questions at first but once I started thinking about what I was curious about from a user point of view it was a bit easier. Although not much of my conversation was focused on only the website but rather the social issue that The Advocates for Human Rights organization focuses on, it was really important to get a better understanding of how younger people relate to heavier social issues. My participant offered that he was angry and depressed when reading about certain social issues which is something I hadn’t really considered. It might be interesting to approach how these social issues can be more balanced and presented so that it doesn’t consistently elicit such negative effects. One thing that I found extremely useful was the activities where he researched the topic himself. He expressed confusion on how many refugees there actually are in the world and it seemed like there was misinformation so ensuring the information on the website is clear and concise is very important. I also discovered that client stories were engaging to my user and he found them to be helpful in connecting to the cause. Overall, it was a really interesting session that gave me a little bit more insight about the social cause and move away from my own personal biases.
