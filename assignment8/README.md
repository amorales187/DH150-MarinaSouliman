      <hr class="my-4">
      <p> Human rights organizations are crucial as they provide resources for educating the public and engaging with communities that have their rights impeded upon. America has been an opportunity to many for escaping violence and discrimination but it has become increasingly difficult to seek asylum in the US due to current policies. Through this design project, I aimed to provide greater accessibility to resources provided through a human rights organiztion with the hope of easing the process of applying for asylum.

                <p class="card-text">Many nonprofit organizations work to educate the public and get them involved with enacting tangible change. Through comprehensive and easy to use websites, users can learn more during their visit and can be more engaged with the educational material. Becoming educated about human rights issues around the world is the first step in understanding how we can help. The Advocates of Human Rights organization aims to educate the public, provide services and resources to those effected by human rights violations. Improving the website's design is crucial in making it easy and aesthetically pleasing to users who are interested in the organization and can aid in relaying the organization's method.The Advocates for Human Rights website is functional but relies heavily on an outdated design that isn't very intuitive to many users. The design is text heavy and utilizes hyperlinks that can be lost within the wall of text. The website has a lot of repeated information and interaction points on many of its pages and reducing that clutter can be very helpful in making the webpages easier to navigate. By simplifying and reorganizing the website, we can help the functionality and design of the website greatly. </p>

                <p class="card-text">The Advocates for Human Rights has a home page with a navigation toolbar near the top. It helps users navigate through the pages in a categorized way. The majority of the content is heavily centered in the middle of the page. The text is very basic and there are not many visuals or images provided on the website with the exception of three or four images. The website is very basic but is extremely text heavy. It's difficult to navigate at times because of at times clunky design and because it doesn't utilize the entire webpage it feels very crowded. There are a lot of places where improvement can occur for the sake of the usability. Overall, using more design elements to separate the text and effectively relay the information is essential in improving usability. Consolidating certain elements and webpages would be very helpful in having a more minimalist design that is easier to navigate. Utilizing the entire space provided on the webpage in an organized manner would make the website a lot easier to use.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The purpose of a usability test (UT) is to improve the usability of the product by observing and testing the users and gathering their feedback. UT helps to identify specific problems from a heuristic evaluation and tests whether the product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to the users. Compared to a heuristic evaluation or other inspection methods, UT is the best way to understand the participant's behaviors and thoughts while being able to observe them navigate the product.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The purpose of UX storytelling is to shift your perspective to the user's perspective and see the world how they would see it. Creating personas and their story lets you and your team share the same image of the users. Storytelling also helps filter out any biases you or your interviewees had and focus solely on the users.

It allows me to translate my high-level design concepts into physical and tangible entities that other people can interact with in order to identify flaws in functionality.

                <p class="card-text">While timeframe for projects are finite, ideas for implementations can be infinite. Sometimes it is more important to prioritize the most important features and design those well, rather than designing for every-single-feature and creating a “cool” but unusable app. With deadlines approaching and ideas still flowing, I realized I had to focus on the quality of the most important components of the product before letting myself get carried away with “cool” features I wanted to add. This allowed me to stay focused on creating a solid and quality prototype that could be improved and added onto overtime
