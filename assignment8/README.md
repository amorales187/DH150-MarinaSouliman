      <hr class="my-4">
      <p> Human rights organizations are crucial as they provide resources for educating the public and engaging with communities that have their rights impeded upon. America has been an opportunity to many for escaping violence and discrimination but it has become increasingly difficult to seek asylum in the US due to current policies. Through this design project, I aimed to provide greater accessibility to resources provided through a human rights organiztion with the hope of easing the process of applying for asylum.

                <p class="card-text">Many nonprofit organizations work to educate the public and get them involved with enacting tangible change. Through comprehensive and easy to use websites, users can learn more during their visit and can be more engaged with the educational material. Becoming educated about human rights issues around the world is the first step in understanding how we can help. The Advocates of Human Rights organization aims to educate the public, provide services and resources to those effected by human rights violations. Improving the website's design is crucial in making it easy and aesthetically pleasing to users who are interested in the organization and can aid in relaying the organization's method.The Advocates for Human Rights website is functional but relies heavily on an outdated design that isn't very intuitive to many users. The design is text heavy and utilizes hyperlinks that can be lost within the wall of text. The website has a lot of repeated information and interaction points on many of its pages and reducing that clutter can be very helpful in making the webpages easier to navigate. By simplifying and reorganizing the website, we can help the functionality and design of the website greatly. </p>

                <p class="card-text">The Advocates for Human Rights has a home page with a navigation toolbar near the top. It helps users navigate through the pages in a categorized way. The majority of the content is heavily centered in the middle of the page. The text is very basic and there are not many visuals or images provided on the website with the exception of three or four images. The website is very basic but is extremely text heavy. It's difficult to navigate at times because of at times clunky design and because it doesn't utilize the entire webpage it feels very crowded. There are a lot of places where improvement can occur for the sake of the usability. Overall, using more design elements to separate the text and effectively relay the information is essential in improving usability. Consolidating certain elements and webpages would be very helpful in having a more minimalist design that is easier to navigate. Utilizing the entire space provided on the webpage in an organized manner would make the website a lot easier to use.</p>

                <h2 class="card-title">Usability Testing</h2>
                <p class="card-text">The purpose of usability testing is to understand the functionality of the website through a user's eyes. Observing their behaviors, tendencies and understanding of the website as it is is crucial to the design process and allows us to better grasp the issues we might be facing. This website has several target populations and I wanted to test how usability might be different for those separate populations. It offers services for those seeking asylum but it also offers options for volunteering so I tried to gear my usertesting to better understand the two experiences better. Usability for this website is crucial as making the website easier to use would have a great effect on how people engage with the organization and make involvement more likely. I focused on testing four important features of the website that are integral to the website’s function: event information, education access, volunteer accessibility and asylum service information. I decided to add a fourth task to test how usability would be for someone seeking service information but I wanted to make sure that I had three other core usability tests that focused on other aspects of the website. When I did my heuristic analysis of the website, I found the website clunky and overpowering with how much information is presented on a singular page. I think a lot of the issues I found were based on my increased use of the website. Basically, the more I spent time on the website, the more I realized issues with the website which may not translate with my user testing as my user was only on the website for about twenty minutes. There were some passive issues with signing up for newsletters in terms of error documentation that I wasn’t able to test appropriately but are still points I want to focus on in improving the website. My focus was on hwo users interacted with the webiste for information they may potentially look for when first being introduced to the website such as event information, educational material and volunteering documentation.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The purpose of user research is to help us step away from our own biases and understand the user and their intentions and limitations are. User research is an important step in the design process and helps us move forward or revise our expectations of both the users and the website's usability. It allows us to understand the context in which the user would be using the product and explore the topic deeper. To do this, I employed a contextual inquiry approach and used an in person interview to conduct my user research.

                <p class="card-text"> UX storytelling is important in ensuring researchers think of all different types of users. Understandning who might be your potential user is crucial to understanding how different features might be accessible or used by your users. First, by making different personas a researcher steps out of their role and can better understand different types of users they might not be acquainted with. From there journey maps and scenarios are helpful in incorporating these personas with the product you are testing. It helps the researcher expand their understanding of their user base and offers a lot of insight that might otherwise be missed.

                <p class="card-text">This project is meant to help ease the user’s ability to navigate the Advocates for Human Rights website. The website is difficult to navigate at times as it’s wordy and not appropriately organized. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to get input from a user about how they navigate the redesigned elements and how to improve on them. I had a variety of personas focused on capturing who might visit the website. The first persona was a middle aged divorce lawyer, Bernie, who wanted to get involved with immigration law. He was tasked with finding information regarding how to become an Attorney volunteer and filling out the intake form. The second persona I used was that of Jacob, an Egyptian asylum seeker, seeking legal services. He was tasked with finding the legal intake form and finding more information about asylum seekers. Finally, the third persona is that of Julie, a new teacher looking to get involved with her community and find educational material to engage her students. I focused on these tasks because they’re central to the usability of the website and are crucial assets to the organization's services. I created my prototype on my iPad and had my user interact with it using an Apple Pencil. My prototype supports four total tasks essential to the website’s function and the organization’s services. The user was asked to apply to be a volunteer asylum attorney, apply for legal services as an asylum seeker,find educational material for schools/outreach and donate money to the organization.

                <p class="card-text">This project is a high fidelity prototype of the Advocates of Human Rights website created on Figma. The Advocates for Human Rights is an organization that focuses on volunteering within the realm of refugee and asylum issues. The organization provides a variety of resources to refugee and asylum seekers such as legal services, educational material and support networks. This prototype was created to better showcase the functionality of three tasks and three personas, Bernie Hernandez, Jacob Solomon and Julie Lee. The three tasks are filling out a volunteer application, making a donation to the organization, filling out a client intake form and finding educational materials. The high fidelity prototype was adapted from a low fidelity prototype and used UI principles, color and typography to improve upon the design.
