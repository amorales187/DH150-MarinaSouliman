### Introduction: a brief statement about the project 

Many nonprofit organizations work to educate the public and get them involved with enacting tangible change. Through comprehensive and easy to use websites, users can learn more during their visit and can be more engaged with the educational material. Becoming educated about human rights issues around the world is the first step in understanding how we can help. The Advocates of Human Rights organization aims to educate the public, provide services and resources to those effected by human rights violations. Improving the website's design is crucial in making it easy and aesthetically pleasing to users who are interested in the organization and can aid in relaying the organization's method. 

### Design statement: what is the issue and why do you think it's important to resolve the issue by your project
The Advocates for Human Rights website is functional but relies heavily on an outdated design that isn't very intuitive to many users. The design is text heavy and utilizes hyperlinks that can be lost within the wall of text. The website has a lot of repeated information and interaction points on many of its pages and reducing that clutter can be very helpful in making the webpages easier to navigate. By simplifying and reorganizing the website, we can help the functionality and design of the website greatly. 

### Competitor analysis: Heuristics 
summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the existing product or the original website you evaluated

The Advocates for Human Rights has a home page with a navigation toolbar near the top. It helps users navigate through the pages in a categorized way. The majority of the content is heavily centered in the middle of the page. The text is very basic and there are not many visuals or images provided on the website with the exception of three or four images. The website is very basic but is extremely text heavy. It's difficult to navigate at times because of at times clunky design and because it doesn't utilize the entire webpage it feels very crowded. There are a lot of places where improvement can occur for the sake of the usability. Overall, using more design elements to separate the text and effectively relay the information is essential in improving usability. Consolidating certain elements and webpages would be very helpful in having a more minimalist design that is easier to navigate. Utilizing the entire space provided on the webpage in an organized manner would make the website a lot easier to use.
