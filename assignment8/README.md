# Human Rights Advocacy  

## Marina Souliman 

### Introduction: a brief statement about the project 

Many nonprofit organizations work to educate the public and get them involved with enacting tangible change. Through comprehensive and easy to use websites, users can learn more during their visit and can be more engaged with the educational material. Becoming educated about human rights issues around the world is the first step in understanding how we can help. The Advocates of Human Rights organization aims to educate the public, provide services and resources to those effected by human rights violations. Improving the website's design is crucial in making it easy and aesthetically pleasing to users who are interested in the organization and can aid in relaying the organization's method. 

### Design statement: what is the issue and why do you think it's important to resolve the issue by your project
The Advocates for Human Rights website is functional but relies heavily on an outdated design that isn't very intuitive to many users. The design is text heavy and utilizes hyperlinks that can be lost within the wall of text. The website has a lot of repeated information and interaction points on many of its pages and reducing that clutter can be very helpful in making the webpages easier to navigate. By simplifying and reorganizing the website, we can help the functionality and design of the website greatly. 

### Competitor analysis: Heuristics 
summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the existing product or the original website you evaluated

The Advocates for Human Rights has a home page with a navigation toolbar near the top. It helps users navigate through the pages in a categorized way. The majority of the content is heavily centered in the middle of the page. The text is very basic and there are not many visuals or images provided on the website with the exception of three or four images. The website is very basic but is extremely text heavy. It's difficult to navigate at times because of at times clunky design and because it doesn't utilize the entire webpage it feels very crowded. There are a lot of places where improvement can occur for the sake of the usability. Overall, using more design elements to separate the text and effectively relay the information is essential in improving usability. Consolidating certain elements and webpages would be very helpful in having a more minimalist design that is easier to navigate. Utilizing the entire space provided on the webpage in an organized manner would make the website a lot easier to use.

### Competitor analysis: Usability Testing
The purpose of usability testing is to understand the functionality of the website through a user's eyes. Observing their behaviors, tendencies and understanding of the website as it is is crucial to the design process and allows us to better grasp the issues we might be facing.  This website has several target populations and I wanted to test how usability might be different for those separate populations. It offers services for those seeking asylum but it also offers options for volunteering so I tried to gear my usertesting to better understand the two experiences better. Usability for this website is crucial as making the website easier to use would have a great effect on how people engage with the organization and make involvement more likely. I focused on testing four important features of the website that are integral to the website’s function: event information, education access, volunteer accessibility and asylum service information. I decided to add a fourth task to test how usability would be for someone seeking service information but I wanted to make sure that I had three other core usability tests that focused on other aspects of the website. When I did my heuristic analysis of the website, I found the website clunky and overpowering with how much information is presented on a singular page. I think a lot of the issues I found were based on my increased use of the website. Basically, the more I spent time on the website, the more I realized issues with the website which may not translate with my user testing as my user was only on the website for about twenty minutes. There were some passive issues with signing up for newsletters in terms of error documentation that I wasn’t able to test appropriately but are still points I want to focus on in improving the website. My focus was on hwo users interacted with the webiste for information they may potentially look for when first being introduced to the website such as event information, educational material and volunteering documentation.
