      <p class="lead"> <br> Marina Souliman </p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>Human rights organizations are crucial as they provide resources for educating the public and engaging with communities that have their rights impeded upon. America has been an opportunity to many for escaping violence and discrimination but it has become increasingly difficult to seek asylum in the US due to current policies. Through this design project, I aimed to provide greater accessibility to resources provided through a human rights organiztion with the hope of easing the process of applying for asylum.

                <p class="card-text">College radio stations are community focused in their design. Their members are composed entirely of students, faculty, and community figures. Local artists and stories are promoted. They are not held accountable to the demands of advertisers. College radio stations are a platform for the people, no strings attached. However, Radio is an aging medium. Terrestrial Radio stations and conventional radio programming may be diminishing in relevance. </p>

                <p class="card-text">The National Weather Service website works in conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They provide local and national weather forecasts along with detailed maps that contain other meteorological information on maps. They have past weather, safety, and educational material on their website. Overall: The National Weather Service website is not an easily navigable website. However, it is very easy to get lost in the web page. Since the website works with two corporations you never know where a link will take you. This does not make the user experience smooth or enjoyable. The designs change with almost every page change and those pages are also overwhelming with different information and designs. This website needs major improvements.</p>

UT helps to identify specific problems from a heuristic evaluation and tests whether the product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to the users. Compared to a heuristic evaluation or other inspection methods, UT is the best way to understand the participant's behaviors and thoughts while being able to observe them navigate the product.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The purpose of UX storytelling is to shift your perspective to the user's perspective and see the world how they would see it. Creating personas and their story lets you and your team share the same image of the users. Storytelling also helps filter out any biases you or your interviewees had and focus solely on the users.

It allows me to translate my high-level design concepts into physical and tangible entities that other people can interact with in order to identify flaws in functionality. My low-fidelity prototype is used to test how the features I proposed flow within a user's online shopping experience, and focuses on its practicality rather than visual appearance.

                <p class="card-text">While timeframe for projects are finite, ideas for implementations can be infinite. Sometimes it is more important to prioritize the most important features and design those well, rather than designing for every-single-feature and creating a “cool” but unusable app. With deadlines approaching and ideas still flowing, I realized I had to focus on the quality of the most important components of the product before letting myself get carried away with “cool” features I wanted to add. This allowed me to stay focused on creating a solid and quality prototype that could be improved and added onto overtime
