# Human Rights Education 

## DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
Education is the key to social change. Many nonprofit organizations work to educate the public and get them involved with enacting tangible change. Through comprehensive and easy to use websites, users can learn more during their visit and can be more engaged with the educational material. Becoming educated about human rights issues around the world is the first step in understanding how we can help. Human rights nonprofit organizations typically have two focuses: educating the public and providing services and resources. The first organization I want to focus on is Human Rights First which focuses on advocacy for American ideals through a similar approach. The second organization I want to explore is the Advocates for Human Rights as their website offers educational material as well as a variety of resources and services. By improving the design of this website and making it more user friendly, it will aid both in relaying their educational material better and making the website easy to use for those seeking their legal services. Both of these websites are used to educate the public to bring awareness about a variety of issues impeding on vulnerable populations' human rights. Furthermore, both offer legal services to refugees and those seeking asylum. With my heuristic evaluation I hope to set out to discover ways to make their websites better for users interested in exploring these nonprofit organizations and their cause as well to those seeking out the legal services.
