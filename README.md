# Human Rights Education 

## DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
Education is the key to social change. Many nonprofit organizations work to educate the public and get them involved with enacting tangible change. Through comprehensive and easy to use websites, users can learn more during their visit and can be more engaged with the educational material. Becoming educated about human rights issues around the world is the first step in understanding how we can help. Human rights nonprofit organizations typically have two focuses: educating the public and providing services and resources. The first organization I want to focus on is Human Rights First which focuses on advocacy for American ideals through a similar approach. The second organization I want to explore is the Advocates for Human Rights as their website offers educational material as well as a variety of resources and services. By improving the design of this website and making it more user friendly, it will aid both in relaying their educational material better and making the website easy to use for those seeking their legal services. Both of these websites are used to educate the public to bring awareness about a variety of issues impeding on vulnerable populations' human rights. Furthermore, both offer legal services to refugees and those seeking asylum. With my heuristic evaluation I hope to set out to discover ways to make their websites better for users interested in exploring these nonprofit organizations and their cause as well to those seeking out the legal services.

## Website 1: Human Rights First 
https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/

The Human Rights First website starts at the home page with a heading bar that allows for a user to navigate through an about page, campaigns, topics, resources, media and vets for american ideals. Below that is a slideshow type graphic that offers a look at their initiatives and events. There are a lot of resources and services offered on this website for both the general public and those seeking legal services. 
 
The website is functional and works well but has some UX issues that could help improve usability. It’s often at times overwhelming with a lot of text and has a design that could be more cohesive with a better flow for information. There are some features that feel outdated and could be designed in a more appealing manner. Overall, it’s a functional website that could use a little bit of sprucing up when it comes to certain features.

### 1: Visibility System of Status
There should be an indication to the user that the menu bar can be expanded for example an arrow or some sort of indicator. The resources page does not expand like the others so a user might hover over it and wait to see if it expands. **(1)**

Throughout the website, there are indicators that the user has selected an option whether it be changing the color of the item. This informs the user that their interaction with the system worked and is a good use of this heuristic. Overall, there are consistent indicators for the user that helps support the visibility of system status.

### 2: Match between system and the real world 
Overall there's a good match between the system and real world concepts. The search function works well and as expected. There's a common addition throughout the website that has icons for social media that allows the user to make the connection between the icon and the social media. 

An issue could be seen with the calendar where they have events from previous years. When someone thinks of events, they think of upcoming events and may be misled if they saw events from last year. This doesn’t follow common conventions for event pages and an alternative method for showcasing previous events should be explored. **(2)**

### 3: User Control and Freedom 
If a user clicks on the search button on the top right corner on accident without searching any terms it takes them to the search page. It should not take a user to a different page if they have not searched any items as it can be assumed if they clicked on the icon without writing anything in the search bar it was by mistake. **(2)**

<img src="./searchviolation.png">

The website has clickable social media icons that change the current page a user is on to the respective social media website. I think opening a new tab instead of changing the current user’s page gives the user more freedom to browse between the website and the social media website. **(2)**

If you click on the Vets for American Ideals, it takes you to a new webpage for a different organization. This is misleading to the user as it’s placed with other elements of the website. **(3)**

### 4: Consistency and Standards
At the bottom of the webpage there is a sign up button next to the asylum and donate button. Sign up buttons are typically on the top right corner and it would probably be more visible to the user if it was there. **(2)**

<img src="./consistency.png">

The sign up button and the Take action button are both third on that list of buttons which may confuse the user that they are the same action when in fact they are not. **(3)**

### 5: Error Prevention 
If a user enters the wrong spelling for their email engine there is no warning given and the error is not prevented. In fact, it allows the user to continue on and makes it so they have signed up to the mailing server. The user would not know that they made this error and therefore would wrongfully believe that they were signed up to the mailing list. **(3)**

### 6: Recognition rather than recall
 
The website is very good at categorizing the articles under the specific campaigns or categories so users don’t need to remember what campaign they were looking at. 
<img src="./Goodconsistency.png">

On every page there’s a navigation tool that shows the user where they are in the website. Although this is helpful for decreasing the user’s memory load, it feels like repeated information as the same navigation tool is available in the menu. This screenshot shows that there’s a bar above the article title that says “Home/Campaigns/Title of the Article.” **(2)**

### 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use 
An accelerator that is very common among websites is allowing the logo for the website to take the user to the home. 

<img src="./accelator.png">

These are also considered accelerators that allow the user to go quickly to the social media website. This is a fast way to get to the websites and is available to the user at all times.

### 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design 
The website is very text heavy on the media press releases page and has a lot of information going on. I think providing an article headline and a date to the press release is a more aesthetic design. I personally found the text heavy links very overwhelming and it stopped me from exploring that page. **(3)**

<img src="./WordyText.png">

The home page has a red bar that has a message regarding American rights advocacy and it feels very imposing on the page. It leads to a scroll like message with imagery that’s meant to capture the organization’s mission statement. Although this is unique to the organization, the scroll feature makes the imagery slightly disconnected. **(1)**

<img src="./minimalistdesignscrollthing.png">

On every page there is a share link bar that can feel fairly imposing at times and is even visible for the search page which isn’t necessarily something a user is likely to share, making it just a new element on the page. **(1)**
<img src="./Share-button.png">
 
### 9: Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
If a user inputs a nonexistent address, it provides the user with an input error that specifies that the address was the incorrect input. This is fairly good as it provides the user with a specific error they can fix.

If there’s an incorrect search term, the search offers an error and helps the user figure out what the issue is.

### 10: Help and documentation 
This FAQ page can be improved in terms of design as it just offers a list of questions and a very wordy documentation. It could be improved in terms of size by having the questions serve as a clickable and expandable feature. This would decrease how long it takes to go through the page and can help the user pick the appropriate question without having to go through a lot of information. **(2)**
