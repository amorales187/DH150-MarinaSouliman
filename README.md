# Human Rights Education

# DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
#### Education is the key to social change. Many nonprofit organizations work to educate the public and get them involved with enacting tangible change. Through comprehensive and easy to use websites, users can learn more during their visit and can be more engaged with the educational material. At the root of many issues we face as a society are human rights violations. Becoming educated about human rights issues around the world is the first step in understanding how we can help. The first organization I want to focus on is the Advocates for Human Rights as their website offers educational material as well as a variety of resources and services. The second organization I want to explore is Human Rights First which focuses on advocacy for American ideals through both educational campaigns and resources. With my heuristic evaluation I hope to set out to discover ways to make their websites better for users interested in exploring these nonprofit organizations.
