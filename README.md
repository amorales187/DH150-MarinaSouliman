# Human Rights Education 

## DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
Education is the key to social change. Many nonprofit organizations work to educate the public and get them involved with enacting tangible change. Through comprehensive and easy to use websites, users can learn more during their visit and can be more engaged with the educational material. Becoming educated about human rights issues around the world is the first step in understanding how we can help. Human rights nonprofit organizations typically have two focuses: educating the public and providing services and resources. The first organization I want to focus on is Human Rights First which focuses on advocacy for American ideals through a similar approach. The second organization I want to explore is the Advocates for Human Rights as their website offers educational material as well as a variety of resources and services. By improving the design of this website and making it more user friendly, it will aid both in relaying their educational material better and making the website easy to use for those seeking their legal services. Both of these websites are used to educate the public to bring awareness about a variety of issues impeding on vulnerable populations' human rights. Furthermore, both offer legal services to refugees and those seeking asylum. With my heuristic evaluation I hope to set out to discover ways to make their websites better for users interested in exploring these nonprofit organizations and their cause as well to those seeking out the legal services.

## Website 1: Human Rights First 
https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/

The Human Rights First website starts at the home page with a heading bar that allows for a user to navigate through an about page, campaigns, topics, resources, media and vets for american ideals. Below that is a slideshow type graphic that offers a look at their initiatives and events. There are a lot of resources and services offered on this website for both the general public and those seeking legal services. 
 
The website is functional and works well but has some UX issues that could help improve usability. It’s often at times overwhelming with a lot of text and has a design that could be more cohesive with a better flow for information. There are some features that feel outdated and could be designed in a more appealing manner. Overall, it’s a functional website that could use a little bit of sprucing up when it comes to certain features.

### 1: Visibility System of Status
\-There should be an indication to the user that the menu bar can be expanded for example an arrow or some sort of indicator. The resources page does not expand like the others so a user might hover over it and wait to see if it expands. (1)
