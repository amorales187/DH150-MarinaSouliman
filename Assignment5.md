## Scenarios and Journey Maps 
### Scenario 1 
Bernie is a divorce lawyer who is trying to find pro bono opportunities in immigration law as he wants to transition to that specialization. He is passionate about immigration rights and wants to volunteer at a non-profit helping connect lawyers and clients. He is looking for information about the process as well as the experience from lawyers who have worked with the organization. Bernie is not in a rush to explore his options and would rather take his time. It’s very important to him that he feels like he will be able to make an impact with the help of the organization. 

User case: Bernie opens up the website and scrolls for a little bit. He is unsure where the  opportunity for attorneys would be. He finds the volunteer tab and realizes the attorneys page is also under the volunteering tab. He is searching for attorney related positions and finds an overall landing page titled “Attorney Volunteer Opportunity.” He clicks on it and sees that there are two different types of representation he can look into: Asylum Attorneys and Bond Representation Attorneys. He reads about the information and finds that he wants to work as an Asylum Attorney. He sees there is a contact page for the coordinator if he has any questions and he makes note of it. Interested in what resources are offered, Bernie clicks on the resources tab and sees that they offer a variety of training resources. He is satisfied with the resources provided. He fills in the volunteer form and submits it to the website.

### Scenario 2 
Jacob is a Christian mechanical engineer from Egypt. He is active in his church and is very well known in the community as a Christian leader. He and his family have been targeted and discriminated against due to Jacob’s involvement with their church and their religious background. He is concerned for his family’s safety and wants to seek asylum in America. He hears from his coworker who is also facing discrimination about American organizations who help people with their asylum cases. He decides to research some of these organizations. 

User case: Jacob sits down at his computer and translates the words “asylum seeker legal counsel” from Arabic to English. He finds a bunch of organizations and is slightly overwhelmed by the language barrier but remembers his friend recommended The Advocates for Human Rights website. He googles the organization and finds their website. It’s in English but he sees an option labeled “Asylum Seekers.” He clicks on the link and is relieved to see that there’s an Arabic translation option for the page. The page has the options free legal services, detainee information, asylum FAQ, client stories and an intake form. He reads the asylum FAQ and learns about the different asylum cases. He reads clients' stories and finds people gained asylum for religious persecution. He decides to fill in the intake form and is told he will be contacted in the next 3 weeks with information. He is relieved that he has taken this important step.
